This is a set of uBlock filters to make browsing the Behance website a more bearable experience, especially for people with small screens.

These rules fix many of the annoying elements on Behance's website, such as the sticky navbar, sticky search panel, and sign up nags/pop-ups.

## Usage
Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SavioMenifer/make-behance-usable-again/main/filters.txt` to your uBlock filter list, or copy individual rules from `filters.txt` to your "My filters" list.

## Contributing
Feel free to suggest improvements by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.
